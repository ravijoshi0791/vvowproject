    <h1>What is the Presentation Desk?</h1>
    
    <p>This is a web-based application that allows you to share presentation using
    slides from the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">slideshare.net</a> web site, and
    using real-time voice and video from the presenter. There are two roles: a presenter and a viewer.
    There can be one presenter in the room, and any number of veiwers.</p>
    
    <p><b>Warning:</b> This software uses Websocket and works only with Chrome browser, because other
    browsers do not correctly implement the Websocket protocol.</p>
    
    <p>In an empty room, the first participant who clicks on "start presentation" becomes the presenter.
    The presenter's audio and video is broadcast to all the viewers. If a viewer wants to ask question,
    he clicks on "raise hand" button. The presenter can click on the "allow" button for that viewer so that
    the viewer's audio and video also gets streams to everyone. During such question/answer time, both the
    presenter and one viewer are viewed by everyone.</p>
    
    <p>The presenter can paste a slideshare.net URL after clicking on "share slides". Once a slide is shared
    the presenter can control the next and previous navigation using the two buttons on the bottom. The mouse
    movement of the presenter is captured and delivered to all the viewers relative to the position of the
    slide.</p>
    
    <p>All participants can take part in the text chat. Before sending a text messages or raising hand,
    a participant needs to set his name when prompted. The text chat history displays full HTML so all
    the HTML tags are rendered. This could be a security issue, but since we don't do any authentication or
    reserved resources, we don't care at this time.</p>
    
    <p>The audio and video communication component is built using the
    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/flash-videoio">Flash VideoIO</a> project, and the signaling
    component is built on top of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/vvowproject/">Voice and
    Video on Web</a> project.
